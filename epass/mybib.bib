abstract = {The first generation of European e-passports will be issued in 2006. We discuss how borders are crossed regarding the security and privacy erosion of the proposed schemes, and show which borders need to be crossed to improve the security and the privacy protection of the next generation of e-passports. In particular we discuss attacks on Basic Access Control due to the low entropy of the data from which the access keys are derived, we sketch the European proposals for Extended Access Control and the weaknesses in that scheme, and show how fundamentally different design decisions can make e-passports more secure.

abstract = {Abstract. The first generation e-passport standard is proven to be in- secure and prone to various attacks. To strengthen, the European Union (EU) has proposed an Extended Access Control (EAC) mechanism for e-passports that intends to provide better security in protecting biomet- ric information of the e-passport bearer. But, our analysis shows, the EU proposal fails to address many security and privacy issues that are paramount in implementing a strong security mechanism.In this paper we propose an on-line authentication mechanism for electronic passports that addresses the weakness in existing implemen- tations, of both The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU. Our proposal utilises ICAO PKI implementation, thus requiring very little modifications to the existing infrastructure which is already well established.},

The initial standard was made by the ICAO and it has been quickly followed by the Extended Access Control (EAC). In this paper we discuss about the evolution of these standards and more precisely on the evolution of EAC. We intend to give a realistic survey on these standards. We discuss about their problems, such as the inexistence of a clock in the biometric passports and the absence of a switch preventing the lecture of a closed passport. We also look at the issue with retrocompatibility that could be easily solved and the issue with terminal revocation that is harder.},

abstract = {ePassports are biometric identification documents that contain RFID Tags and are primarily used for border security. The embedded RFID Tags are capable of storing data, performing low cost computations and cryptography, and communicating wirelessly. Since 2004, we have witnessed the development and widespread deployment of three generations of electronic passports - The ICAO First Generation ePassport (2004), Extended Access Control (EAC v1.0) ePassports (2006), and Extended Access Control with Password Authentication and Connection Establishment (EAC v2.1) ePassports (2008). Currently, over thirty million ePassports have been issued around the world. In this paper, we provide an introductory study of the technologies implemented in ePassports - Biometrics, RFID, and Public Key Infrastructures; and then go on to analyze the protocols implemented in each of the three generations of ePassports, finally we point out their shortcomings and scope for future related research.},
