@article{Haken2010,
abstract = {The Continuum Fingerboard is a Midi performance controller that offers real-time 3-D continuous control for every finger that is placed on its playing surface. Its novel design presents unique performance challenges and possibilities. Like a fretless instrument, the performer must rely on audio feedback, finger memory, and manual dexterity for accurate intonation and expression. The Continuum requires its own technique, different from any other instrument. With a traditional music keyboard, it is normal for the performer to feel the key hit a hard stop for each note, even if the performer is playing quietly. Also, traditional keyboards are usually velocity sensitive; a single velocity value is determined by the speed of the key movement. In contrast, the Continuum is both velocity sensitive and, more importantly, pressure sensitive. It initially outputs a single velocity level, and then continually outputs a stream of pressure, pitch, and front-back position updates until the note is terminated. The Continuum is designed for a fast and relatively lighter touch than other musical instruments, so it is unusual to hit the hard stop (or "bottom out") except for the very loudest notes. Various Continuum-specific performance techniques utilized by performers will be presented.},

Here, a clock mutation, timeless (tim), is described that produces arrhythmia for both behaviors. The effects of tim on behavioral rhythms are likely to involve products of the X chromosome-linked clock gene period (per), because tim alters circadian oscillations of per RNA. Genetic mapping places tim on the left arm of the second chromosome between dumpy (dp) and decapentaplegic (dpp).},

@article{Smolen2001,
abstract = {Both positive and negative feedback loops of transcriptional regulation have been proposed to be important for the generation of circadian rhythms. To test the sufficiency of the proposed mechanisms, two differential equation-based models were constructed to describe the Neurospora crassa and Drosophila melanogaster circadian oscillators. In the model of the Neurospora oscillator, FRQ suppresses frq transcription by binding to a complex of the transcriptional activators WC-1 and WC-2, thus yielding negative feedback. FRQ also activates synthesis of WC-1, which in turn activates frq transcription, yielding positive feedback. In the model of the Drosophila oscillator, PER and TIM are represented by a "lumped" variable, "PER." PER suppresses its own transcription by binding to the transcriptional regulator dCLOCK, thus yielding negative feedback. PER also binds to dCLOCK to de-repress dclock, and dCLOCK in turn activates per transcription, yielding positive feedback. Both models displayed circadian oscillations that were robust to parameter variations and to noise and that entrained to simulated light/dark cycles. Circadian oscillations were only obtained if time delays were included to represent processes not modeled in detail (e.g., transcription and translation). In both models, oscillations were preserved when positive feedback was removed.},

A game manager program sends the game playing programs a description of a game's rules and objectives in a well-defined game description language. A central challenge in creating effective general game playing programs is that of constructing heuristic evaluation functions from game descriptions. This paper describes a method for constructing evaluation functions that represent exact values of simplified games. The simplified games are abstract models that incorporate the most essential aspects of the original game, namely payoff, control, and termination. Results of applying this method to a sampling of games suggest that heuristic evaluation functions based on our method are both comprehensible and effective.},

abstract = {Thanks to genetic and biochemical advances on the molecular mechanism of circadian rhythms in Drosophila, theoretical models closely related to experimental observations can be considered for the regulatory mechanism of the circadian clock in this organism. Modeling is based on the autoregulatory negative feedback exerted by a complex between PER and TIM proteins on the expression of per and tim genes. The model predicts the occurrence of sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness. When incorporating light-induced TIM degradation, the model accounts for damping of oscillations in constant light, entrainment of the rhythm by light-dark cycles of varying period or photoperiod, and phase shifting by light pulses. The model further provides a molecular dynamical explanation for the permanent or transient suppression of circadian rhythmicity triggered in a variety of organisms by a critical pulse of light. Finally, the model shows that to produce a robust rhythm the various clock genes must be expressed at the appropriate levels since sustained oscillations only occur in a precise range of parameter values.

Such oscillations are possible when repression is due to the metabolite, but only when there is a co-operative repression of such a high order as to be unlikely in practice.},

abstract = {Biochemical studies indicate that the Drosophila timeless protein (Tim) is a stoichiometric partner of the period protein (Per) in fly head extracts. A Per-Tim heterodimeric complex explains the reciprocal autoregulation of the proteins on transcription. The complex is under clock control, and many circadian features of the Tim cycle resemble those of the Per cycle. However, Tim is rapidly degraded in the early morning or in response to light, releasing Per from the complex. The Per-Tim complex is a functional unit of the Drosophila circadian clock, and Tim degradation may be the initial response of the clock to light.},

The truly worldwide reach of the Web has brought with it a new realization among computer scientists and laypeople of the enormous importance of usability and user interface design. In the last ten years, much has become understood about what works in search interfaces from a usability perspective, and what does not. Researchers and practitioners have developed a wide range of innovative interface ideas, but only the most broadly acceptable make their way into major web search engines. This book summarizes these developments, presenting the state of the art of search interface design, both in academic research and in deployment in commercial systems. Many books describe the algorithms behind search engines and information retrieval systems, but the unique focus of this book is specifically on the user interface. It will be welcomed by industry professionals who design systems that use search interfaces as well as graduate students and academic researchers who investigate information systems.},

abstract = {Circadian clocks can be reset by light stimulation. To investigate the mechanism of this phase shifting, the effects of light pulses on the protein and messenger RNA products of the Drosophila clock gene period (per) were measured. Photic stimuli perturbed the timing of the PER protein and messenger RNA cycles in a manner consistent with the direction and magnitude of the phase shift. In addition, the recently identified clock protein TIM (for timeless) interacted with PER in vivo, and this association was rapidly decreased by light. This disruption of the PER-TIM complex in the cytoplasm was accompanied by a delay in PER phosphorylation and nuclear entry and disruption in the nucleus by an advance in PER phosphorylation and disappearance. These results suggest a mechanism for how a unidirectional environmental signal elicits a bidirectional clock response.},

Genetic approaches in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, have revealed widely conserved molecular gears of these 24-h timers. Yet much less is known about how these cell-autonomous clocks confer temporal information to modulate cellular functions. Here we discuss our current knowledge of circadian clock function in Drosophila, providing an overview of the molecular underpinnings of circadian clocks. We then describe the neural network important for circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, including how these molecular clocks might influence neuronal function. Finally, we address a range of behaviors and physiological systems regulated by circadian clocks, including discussion of specific peripheral oscillators and key molecular effectors where they have been described. These studies reveal a remarkable complexity to circadian pathways in this "simple" model organism.},

abstract = {Transcription of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for Notch signaling molecules oscillates with 2-hour cycles, and this oscillation is important for coordinated somite segmentation. However, the molecular mechanism of such oscillation remains to be determined. Here, we show that serum treatment of cultured cells induces cyclic expression of both mRNA and protein of the Notch effector Hes1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factor, with 2-hour periodicity. Cycling is cell-autonomous and depends on negative autoregulation of hes1 transcription and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of Hes1 protein. Because Hes1 oscillation can be seen in many cell types, this clock may regulate timing in many biological systems.},

@article{Allada1998,
abstract = {We report the identification, characterization, and cloning of a novel Drosophila circadian rhythm gene, dClock. The mutant, initially called Jrk, manifests dominant effects: heterozygous flies have a period alteration and half are arrhythmic, while homozygous flies are uniformly arrhythmic. Furthermore, these flies express low levels of the two clock proteins, PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM), due to low per and tim transcription. Mapping and cloning of the Jrk gene indicates that it encodes the Drosophila homolog of mouse Clock. The mutant phenotype results from a premature stop codon that eliminates much of the putative activation domain of this bHLH-PAS transcription factor, thus explaining the dominant features of Jrk. The remarkable sequence conservation strongly supports common clock components present in the common ancestor of Drosophila and mammals.},

@article{Harris2005,
abstract = {The p53 pathway responds to stresses that can disrupt the fidelity of DNA replication and cell division. A stress signal is transmitted to the p53 protein by post-translational modifications. This results in the activation of the p53 protein as a transcription factor that initiates a program of cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis. The transcriptional network of p53-responsive genes produces proteins that interact with a large number of other signal transduction pathways in the cell and a number of positive and negative autoregulatory feedback loops act upon the p53 response. There are at least seven negative and three positive feedback loops described here, and of these, six act through the MDM-2 protein to regulate p53 activity. The p53 circuit communicates with the Wnt-beta-catenin, IGF-1-AKT, Rb-E2F, p38 MAP kinase, cyclin-cdk, p14/19 ARF pathways and the cyclin G-PP2A, and p73 gene products. There are at least three different ubiquitin ligases that can regulate p53 in an autoregulatory manner: MDM-2, Cop-1 and Pirh-2. The meaning of this redundancy and the relative activity of each of these feedback loops in different cell types or stages of development remains to be elucidated. The interconnections between signal transduction pathways will play a central role in our understanding of cancer.},

@article{Huang1995,
abstract = {The periods of circadian clocks are relatively temperature-insensitive. Indeed, the perL mutation in the Drosophila melanogaster period gene, a central component of the clock, affects temperature compensation as well as period length. The per protein (PER) contains a dimerization domain (PAS) within which the perL mutation is located. Amino acid substitutions at the perL position rendered PER dimerization temperature-sensitive. In addition, another region of PER interacted with PAS, and the perL mutation enhanced this putative intramolecular interaction, which may compete with PAS-PAS intermolecular interactions. Therefore, temperature compensation of circadian period in Drosophila may be due in part to temperature-independent PER activity, which is based on competition between inter- and intramolecular interactions with similar temperature coefficients.},

abstract = {Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a new best-first search method that started a revolution in the field of Computer Go. Parallelizing MCTS is an important way to increase the strength of any Go program. In this article, we discuss three parallelization methods for MCTS: leaf parallelization, root parallelization, and tree parallelization. To be effective tree parallelization requires two techniques: adequately handling of (1) local mutexes and (2) virtual loss. Experiments in 13Ã—13 Go reveal that in the program Mango root parallelization may lead to the best results for a specific time setting and specific program parameters. However, as soon as the selection mechanism is able to handle more adequately the balance of exploitation and exploration, tree parallelization should have attention too and could become a second choice for parallelizing MCTS. Preliminary experiments on the smaller 9Ã—9 board provide promising prospects for tree parallelization.},

abstract = {We have analyzed and compared the circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila melanogaster and D.pseudoobscura. The rhythms of D.pseudoobscura are stronger and the periods shorter than those of D.melanogaster. We have also transformed D.melanogaster flies with a hybrid gene containing the coding region of the D.pseudoobscura period (per) gene. Behavioral assays of flies containing this hybrid gene show that the per protein encoded by the D.pseudoobscura per gene is able to rescue the rhythmic deficiencies of arrhythmic, pero1 D.melanogaster. More important, the rhythms of some of these strains are stronger and the periods shorter than those of D.melanogaster (and those of transformants which carry the equivalent D.melanogaster per gene construct) and hence resemble those of D.pseudoobscura. The results suggest that the primary amino acid sequence of the per gene encodes species-specific behavioral instructions that are detectable when only the per gene is transferred to a different species.},

@article{Petersen1988,
abstract = {We have analyzed and compared the circadian locomotor activity rhythms of Drosophila melanogaster and D.pseudoobscura. The rhythms of D.pseudoobscura are stronger and the periods shorter than those of D.melanogaster. We have also transformed D.melanogaster flies with a hybrid gene containing the coding region of the D.pseudoobscura period (per) gene. Behavioral assays of flies containing this hybrid gene show that the per protein encoded by the D.pseudoobscura per gene is able to rescue the rhythmic deficiencies of arrhythmic, pero1 D.melanogaster. More important, the rhythms of some of these strains are stronger and the periods shorter than those of D.melanogaster (and those of transformants which carry the equivalent D.melanogaster per gene construct) and hence resemble those of D.pseudoobscura. The results suggest that the primary amino acid sequence of the per gene encodes species-specific behavioral instructions that are detectable when only the per gene is transferred to a different species.},
